DuplicateFinder fails to find duplicate files in directory mentioned if the directory has sub folders

When the directory given in the application to find duplicate files has subfolders then when launch operation is performed then the application searches the duplicate files in the first subfolder and returns the results from that subfolder. 
e.g: 
- Folder X is the directory where the duplicate files are need to be searched and it contains 5 duplicate files of same size.
- Folder X1 is a subfolder in folder X and it contains 3 duplicate files of same size
- When launch operation is performed with input as directory path mentioned to X then result of 3 duplicates from X1 folder is returned instead of the 5 duplicate from X folder.
